# Music Collection Manager (need a better name)

This app is designed for someone to manage their music collection

## Future plans

This is very early on in development (not even and official build yet) there are many things I would like to work on and they will be updated here when I'm working on them.
- Different types of formats (CD, Cassette, Vinyl, etc)
- Allow adding prices to entires
- More statistical data

If there any ideas you wish to submit please submit them in the issues page
